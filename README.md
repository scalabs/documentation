## Development Process

- oriented on Scrum, you can watch the basics here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PPO5GwSo0d4
- for smaller projects no clear sprints, but weekly briefing & de-briefing
- **GitHub is our most important communication channel!** We rely heavily on *public documentation for the whole development team* in our projects! **THIS MEANS:**
   - Always keep your issues and pull requests up to date
   - Resolve conversations, describe problems inside of issues and pull requests, with mentioning all of the people involved, instead of phone calls and private chats. 
   - For work-related time-sensitive conversations, Google Chat is the standard choice!
- make sure to use our [issue templates](https://github.com/scalabs/github-workflows/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) before you file a question, issue, bug report or simliar

### Types of project tasks

- Feature requests (labeled as *feature request*, previously *enhancement*)
- Implementation tasks (typically sub-tasks of feature-requests)
- Exploratory tasks


### Project management implementation on GitHub

- Each repository's issues are the full **backlog** for a project
- Pull requests and feature branches are used to work on issues from the backlog
- Project boards (Kanban-style) are used for *sprints*.
- Each sprint will be planned in a *kick-off* and *retrospective meeting*.

### Working with Project boards

1. Backlog

TODO

2. Iterations (sprints)

- Refinement (mid-sprint)
- Sprint Demo (after sprint with client)

TODO

### Testing

- Unit & Integration tests TODO
- Acceptance tests TODO
