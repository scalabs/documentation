# Guide on Debugging and Troubleshooting

## "Triage" and "Escalation" levels

1. **Try to solve it on your own.** Try writing unit tests, debugging via breakpoints, etc. Narrow down the sources of the issue as much as possible.
2. **When you are stuck, take the time to document the problem** as a *Bug report*.
    - Another person can voluntarily jump in to help with the problem.
    - It's not about skills or not living up to the standards, but time transparency. Delays are normal, but if they are not communicated clearly, they upset people.
    - It Helps to plan future iterations/sprints more realistically.
    - Don't be afraid to open a "stupid sounding" issue. Mistakes or knowledge gaps are normal and only if you ask, you learn from them.
3. **Ask team members to review the problem**, by mentioning them on GitHub.
4. **Communicate with the team leader**, so they know about the obstacles.
