### Asynchronous standup

We have a daily asynchronous standup in a Google Chat group ("Scalabs Standup"), where everyone is just posting a message what they're doing that day.

### Weekly debrief

A weekly feedback round where we summarize what has been done this week and what our experiences were.

### Meetings for iterations/sprints

> Sprint-participants organize their work in a kick-off, refinement (mid-sprint), retrospective meeting (sprint demo), as well as daily standups.
